Business Case

A newly set up Ecommerce operation is spending a lot of time manually investigation cases of potential fraud. It would be a massive time/money saving oportunity to create a machine learning system that could predict if an order is likely to be fraudulent and to give insight into the current risk and trends.


Plan

Dashboard to show current cases of potential fraud
It will also need to show the trend of increase/decrease
Calculate time/money saved based on the removal of the manual process
Allow the user to enter parameters and be told if this is likely to be a fraudulent order
